But done properly, this architecture can be used to implement real-time, multi-user shared state between many users of the same web applications. Using HTTP requests to dispatch stores, and Websocket to broadcast updates, Flux over the Wire has the potential to trivialize several hard problems. While the idea of using Websockets to back Flux is rather straightforward, doing it in a way that scales up to tens of thousands of concurrent viewers can prove challenging. In addition, Flux over the Wire offers an interface which considerably eases server-side rendering, as it completely abstracts data fetching and data syncing from the React views that tap into its stores and dispatch its actions.</p>\n",

And we&#39;ve started exploring similar simplifications in the data layer, embracing the UI’s role as part of a distributed system. First, we&#39;ll share how user experience choices are a primary influence on how we design the data layer, especially for teams developing new products with full-stack capabilities. Working with data from multiple backend services has powerful benefits, and shapes the problem space for UI engineering. Next, we&#39;ll look at how React and Flux approaches can help in our problem scenarios. Yet even after the advances in React’s component model, the data layer is still an important source of complexity as an app grows and changes over time. Finally, we&#39;ll look at new approaches we’ve been exploring, and how designs like decoupling &#39;recording facts&#39; from &#39;computing views of those facts&#39; have influenced UI engineering. These designs nudge teams towards simplicity when creating impactful user-facing improvements like real-time updates, optimistic commits, and graceful handling of network outages.</p>\n",

More importantly though, we are focused on bringing great experiences to consumers of applications built using React Router. In this talk, we will discuss how your users can benefit from the many tools the router provides including server-side rendering, real URLs on native devices, and much, much more.</p>\n",

Using HTTP requests to dispatch stores, and Websocket to broadcast updates, Flux over the Wire has the potential to trivialize several hard problems. While the idea of using Websockets to back Flux is rather straightforward, doing it in a way that scales up to tens of thousands of concurrent viewers can prove challenging. In addition, Flux over the Wire offers an interface which considerably eases server-side rendering, as it completely abstracts data fetching and data syncing from the React views that tap into its stores and dispatch its actions.</p>\n",

And we&#39;ve started exploring similar simplifications in the data layer, embracing the UI’s role as part of a distributed system. First, we&#39;ll share how user experience choices are a primary influence on how we design the data layer, especially for teams developing new products with full-stack capabilities. Working with data from multiple backend services has powerful benefits, and shapes the problem space for UI engineering. Next, we&#39;ll look at how React and Flux approaches can help in our problem scenarios. Yet even after the advances in React’s component model, the data layer is still an important source of complexity as an app grows and changes over time. Finally, we&#39;ll look at new approaches we’ve been exploring, and how designs like decoupling &#39;recording facts&#39; from &#39;computing views of those facts&#39; have influenced UI engineering. These designs nudge teams towards simplicity when creating impactful user-facing improvements like real-time updates, optimistic commits, and graceful handling of network outages.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Chrome is great, but 3rd party extensions make it better. The iPhone\n    is great, but apps make it better. You React-app may be great, but\n    imagine if you could safely and robustly allow 3rd party extensions to\n    enhance it.\n    We&#39;ll talk about specific features of React &amp; Flux, React CSS,\n    programming design patterns, and custom libraries, which can turn a\n    static application into a dynamic platform that an ecosystem of\n    developers can build on top of.\n    We&#39;ve built a highly-extensible desktop email client with React &amp; Flux\n    on Atom Shell, and we&#39;ll also show concrete examples of where these\n    tools enabled a 3rd party ecosystem of email plugins.\n    Our goal is for you to take away how to use React to be more than just\n    great application developers, but now great platform developers as\n    well.</p>\n",
